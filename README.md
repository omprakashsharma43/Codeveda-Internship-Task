## ðŸ“‚ Task List & Descriptions

### ðŸ”¹ Level 1 (Basic)
1. *Task 1 â€“ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing*
   - Loaded raw dataset with missing values and duplicates.  
   - Handled missing data (imputation/removal).  
   - Removed duplicates and standardized inconsistent formats (dates, categorical variables).  
   - *Outcome:* Clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset.

2. *Task 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
   - Computed summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).  
   - Visualized data distributions using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.  
   - Identified correlations between numerical features.  
   - *Outcome:* Gained insights into dataset structure and relationships.

3. *Task 3 â€“ Basic Data Visualization*
   - Created bar plots, line charts, and scatter plots.  
   - Customized titles, labels, and legends.  
   - Exported plots for reporting.  
   - *Outcome:* Clear visual representation of data distributions and trends.

### ðŸ”¹ Level 2 (Intermediate)
1. *Task 1 â€“ Regression Analysis*
   - Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn.  
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Evaluated model using RÂ² and Mean Squared Error.  
   - *Outcome:* Built and interpreted a regression model for predictive analytics.

2. *Task 2 â€“ Time Series Analysis*
   - Visualized time-series data to detect trends and seasonality.  
   - Applied decomposition into trend, seasonality, and residuals.  
   - Used moving averages for smoothing.  
   - *Outcome:* Identified key time-based patterns within the dataset.

3. *Task 3 â€“ Clustering Analysis (K-Means)*
   - Standardized dataset using StandardScaler.  
   - Applied K-Means clustering with elbow method to determine optimal clusters.  
   - Visualized clusters in 2D space.  
   - *Outcome:* Grouped similar data points effectively for segmentation.

### ðŸ”¹ Level 3 (Advanced)
1. *Task 1 â€“ Predictive Modeling (Classification)*
   - Preprocessed data with feature scaling and categorical encoding.  
   - Trained models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.  
   - Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
   - Tuned hyperparameters with Grid Search.  
   - *Outcome:* Built a classification pipeline to predict categorical outcomes.

2. *Task 2 â€“ Building Dashboards (Power BI/Tableau)*
   - Imported and cleaned dataset in Power BI/Tableau.  
   - Built interactive dashboards with filters, slicers, and multiple chart types.  
   - Published and shared dashboards for reporting.  
   - *Outcome:* Developed professional dashboards to present insights interactively.

3. *Task 3 â€“ Sentiment Analysis (NLP)*
   - Preprocessed text data (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).  
   - Applied sentiment analysis using NLTK/TextBlob.  
   - Visualized sentiment distribution with word clouds and frequency plots.  
   - *Outcome:* Extracted and visualized customer sentiment from textual data.
